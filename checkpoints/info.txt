Hi, this folder is now empty!

To use the model you have to use train.py file to generate the .h5 files in this directory.

OR,

Download the .h5 files from this 
drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dZQjwpGlB7dr4cB_dBqjzxMTFZsYZPlz

These .h5 models were trained in my local system and uploaded into the drive for plug-play.
